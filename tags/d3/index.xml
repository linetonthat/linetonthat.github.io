      <description>Designed to be printed When I design personal data visualizations, I usually imagine them printed on paper, although they mostly remain in their digital format. However, there are a few that I would like to see materialized. For example, I printed my sister&amp;rsquo;s vegetable garden data visualization for her. In a way, it&amp;rsquo;s a reminder of what she accomplished in the first year of her vegetable garden. It was easy to do, as it&amp;rsquo;s A4 size (the visualization was done with PowerPoint).</description>
