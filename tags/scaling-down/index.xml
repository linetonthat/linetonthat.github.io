      <description>Prior to their annual event, the International Meteor Organization asked its members if they had a poster to share. Although I was unable to attend the event, I submitted a poster in the form of a visual meteor shower calendar for 2023. The organization responded that they could include this poster in their quarterly journal on the back cover. Since their print size is A4 and the version I submitted was intended for A2, I had to check if the current version was acceptable as is or not.</description>
