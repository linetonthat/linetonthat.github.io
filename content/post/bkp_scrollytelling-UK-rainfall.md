Scrollytelling has been on my wishlist for some time. I love this method as it allows guiding the reader step by step through the narrative, using annotations and animations. I actually submitted it to the __[Storytelling with Data Challenge "annotate it!" ](https://community.storytellingwithdata.com/challenges/oct-23-annotate-it/impact-of-climate-change-on-rainfall-in-the-uk-scr)__. To test out the technique, I chose to reimagine a __[data visualization](https://observablehq.com/@linetonthat/will-climate-change-bring-more-rain-to-the-uk)__ that was mostly static. Here is the summary:

## The result
See the scrollytelling version __[here](https://line-ton-that.github.io/UK_precipitations.html)__. NB: This version is best viewed on a desktop computer (or at least on a screen 1100 pixels wide).

## The challenges
There were several challenges I needed to overcome to create the scrollytelling:
1. Identify how to adapt the narrative to this specific format
2. Create D3 data visualizations outside Observable HQ
3. Identify a suitable library and understand how to apply it
4. Add interactivity to the visuals
5. Publish it online

### Identify how to adapt the narrative to this specific format
I've revised the different stages of the story using sketches and draft.io to adapt it to scrollytelling format.

In this new version, I've used annotations and animations at different stages to :

Provide a legend (for example, rainfall projected in blue)

Highlight specific figures (e.g. overall increase of 4.9%)

Highlight specific features of the variation pattern (for example, the months with increase in rain)

Highlight the potential impacts of pattern variation (e.g. longer dry spells)
