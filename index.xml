      <description>Prior to their annual event, the International Meteor Organization asked its members if they had a poster to share. Although I was unable to attend the event, I submitted a poster in the form of a visual meteor shower calendar for 2023. The organization responded that they could include this poster in their quarterly journal on the back cover. Since their print size is A4 and the version I submitted was intended for A2, I had to check if the current version was acceptable as is or not.</description>

      <description>Designed to be printed When I design personal data visualizations, I usually imagine them printed on paper, although they mostly remain in their digital format. However, there are a few that I would like to see materialized. For example, I printed my sister&amp;rsquo;s vegetable garden data visualization for her. In a way, it&amp;rsquo;s a reminder of what she accomplished in the first year of her vegetable garden. It was easy to do, as it&amp;rsquo;s A4 size (the visualization was done with PowerPoint).</description>

      <description>Visualising the sugar consumption of my family After hearing that sugars are widely available in processed foods, I decided to take a closer look at some of the products we typically consume in my family. My goal was to find out how much sugar we consume on a daily basis.
I collected the data from Open Food Facts. My children helped me measure some of the servings. I then built graphs using Tableau public to analyze the data, and created a dashboard to summarize my results.</description>
